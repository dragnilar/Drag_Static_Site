# Pre-Build Events in Visual Studio 2022

Yes, this is a mundane topic. And I suspect that writing about it is as equally as inane. But none the less,
I feel compelled to write a bit about them, since I seldom get to use them.

## What is a Pre-Build Event?

If the name doesn't give it away, it's basically a placeholder where you can tell Visual Studio to run other commands before your program
is built / compiled / constructed / created. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/how-to-specify-build-events-csharp?view=vs-2022" target="_blank">Beyond that, I guess you can read MSDN,
if you want a more thorough, albeit Microsofty, explanation.</a>

### Using them with making this Blog site

I initially did not intend to make this site into part static generator, but I admit, the temptation to try it got to me.
Thus I ended up figuring out how to get it to work via the following setup:

<a href="Posts/Images/PreBuildEventSetup1.png"><img src="/Posts/Images/PreBuildEventSetup1.png" height="700" Width="500" target="_blank" title="Project Setup"></a>

1. The Blazor project for this site. When it runs, it fires off a pre-build event to build the project called PostMetaDataGenerator
2. The outputs of PostMetaDataGenerator go here.
3. See more below about PostMetaDataGenerator.

#### The specific pre-build event looks like this:

<a href="Posts/Images/PreBuildEventSetup2.png"><img src="/Posts/Images/PreBuildEventSetup2.png" width="500" target="_blank" title="Project Setup"></a>


`dotnet build $(ProjectDir)../PostMetaDataGenerator/PostMetaDataGenerator.csproj -o $(ProjectDir)/PreBuildUtils/`

`dotnet $(ProjectDir)/PreBuildUtils/PostMetaDataGenerator.dll`


ℹ️ So in other words:

1. We first run a dotnet build on PostMetaDataGenerator.
2. PostMetaDataGenerator and all of its files are placed into the PreBuildUtils folder in Drag_Static_Site's project.
3. DotNet then runs the PostMetaDataGenerator's dll (I had to use the DLL for the ubuntu VM that Github actions provides).
4. **PostMetaDataGenerator** itself just runs through the posts in the site's wwwroot, and creates a posts.json file in wwwroot.

The post.json file... is just a hacky flat file database. It's used by the site to keep track of all the blog posts. 💀

### After-Thoughts

I admit, it's crude (I do not intend to reinvent [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) or the opaquely documented [Statiq](https://www.statiq.dev/)).
Still, I'm happy with the end result. 

Now, here's the fun part - let's see if the whole thing builds without needing to be adjusted for github actions.

<s>I'll make an edit to this post, in case you want to see the results.</s>

<sub>**Update (10/27/2023):** I adjusted the pre-build noted up above to factor in Github Actions and the Dot Net SDK knowing what to do with $(SolutionDir).</sub>
