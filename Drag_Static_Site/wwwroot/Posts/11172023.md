# Dot Net Conf 2024

This year's .NET conf felt both enjoyable but also... weird.


## Good Things

- Team ASP.NET was definitely the star of the show, [thanks in no small part to the efforts of the always enjoyable Daniel Roth & Steve Sanderson 🔗](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwZdtLEtROA&list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oULyHSPBx-tQzePOYlhvrAU&index=3&pp=iAQB). Their demos of Blazor are always top  notch and highly motivational. 
- [The EF Core session 🔗](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8iH5QnkIJo&list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oULyHSPBx-tQzePOYlhvrAU&index=8) had some stuff to show, and some of it is definitely compelling, including the new JSON features. 
  - Whether or not I'll get to play with the JSON features is another question... my company doesn't have any major use for it (yet).

## The Weird Things

- [I think the announcement of .NET Aspire could have been fleshed out a bit differently 🔗](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mna5fg7QGz8&list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oULyHSPBx-tQzePOYlhvrAU&index=1). There wasn't a very good hook at the start of it that made me feel like Aspire is something I WANT to use. This is not to say I do not see the value in it - it looks very useful when dealing with a large complex system composed of many different moving parts. The problem isn't with that part; what needed to be shown more was how Aspire could be used in a simple system setup. 
  - Hopefully this isn't going to be the format for future Aspire demos and talks. I think if they can refine it and show simpler examples of the "magic" that David Fowler mentioned, then it will help garner more interest in the product.
  - Another thing I am also not sure about, is how Aspire fits into the grand scheme of CI/CD / DevOps. Again, I wish they had gone into more detail about those areas.


## The Bad Things

- Team MAUI I've pretty much given up on, beyond as to whether or not MSFT continues to support Blazor MAUI Hybrid. I wish MSFT would just buy Avalonia and make that their next gen XAML instead of trying to continue to leveradge the debt of Xamarin and Win UI / UWP.
  - The above is especially true for the fact that we still have no designer for MAUI. It's a shame we have to rely upon the less than stellar Hot Reload. The fact that there was no mention of the designer in their roadmap was disappointing.
  - I'll admit [this session 🔗](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4saU9BNY6l4&list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oULyHSPBx-tQzePOYlhvrAU&index=11)was not as bad as the one from last year, but with knowing all of the issues with MAUI, the session unfortunately was not enough to change my opinion on its seemingly bleak fate.

- [Team AI / Semantic Kernel is hard to get excited about when it's being headed up by Scott Hanselman 🔗](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_PfDjcWIeA&list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oULyHSPBx-tQzePOYlhvrAU&index=9&pp=iAQB).
  - Not going to go into detail here, but let's just say I don't like Scott's voice.


## Still Need To Watch

- [The What's New in C# 12 Video 🔗](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by-GL-SjHdc&list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oULyHSPBx-tQzePOYlhvrAU&index=6)
