# Why Blazor?

I'll make it no secret that I really do love Blazor. It's IMO, one of the best things Microsoft has put out in the past 3-5 years.
(my thoughts about MSFT though are many, so I will save that for another blog post). 

I also think it makes web development more fun! For example, you feel like you're able to accomplish a lot more, a lot faster, thanks to the wonderful tooling within the .NET Stack:

# And yes, I love being a .NET Developer

.NET / the MS stack has been a personal favorite of mine since I was introduced to it in College, over 15 years ago.

### Here are some of the things I like to use for both work and fun / non-work programming:
- Jetbrains Rider  - _My personal preference_
- Visual Studio 2022 + ReSharper

# What Else Will Be Here Besides A Blog?

Maybe(?):

    - My Resume (Since I stopped using LinkedIn... 🤭)
    - Some dead simple Blazor componets made for no good reason
    - Anything else I haven't thought of...
