# Microsoft Ignite 2024 - The Age of Sataya's Next Gamble

I have taken notice that Ignite 2024 is being overly saturated with AI advertising. While this certainly is not a surprise, considering the 
fact that Microsoft (MSFT) previously bought Chat GPT earlier this year. Since they purchased it, they've been riding high on
the hype and have been showing it with their stock prices.

[MSFT bought Chat GPT earlier this year 🔗](https://www.technocracy.news/microsoft-invests-10-billion-in-chatgpt-maker-openai/) 

Unfortunately, I am skeptical (or even, cynical) about MSFT going forward with this "AI Company" image. Here are a couple examples as to why:

## MSFT: ML.NET - Great If It Fits Your Use Case...

 [ML.NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/machine-learning/how-does-mldotnet-work) 🔗 has been around for longer than a couple of years now. Despite its age, it doesn't really let you do a whole lot with it. 

THAT IS, unless you are trying to get it to do something where the use case support (and data) exist. 
If it doesn't support the use case, then you are going to be stuck trying to fit a huge square peg in a sometimes, very, very narrow hole. And if you do not have the data,
well, unless a pre-existing model (I.E. Image.Net, Chat GPT, etc) can work for you, you may be without the means to create a model.

Oh yes, and you may end up in a situation also where something you're trying to accomplish, may have already been done WITHOUT AI. 
This isn't to say it's not worth the time to learn how to do it WITH AI, but don't expect a huge ROI if what you're doing doesn't make a lot of sense with AI's involvement. 

But the last point aside, again, ML.NET shows that Microsoft really has a long ways to go before they can begin to say with full confidence
that they are the "AI Company". Or "AI Software Company". Or whatever marketing gimic they are using.

## Power Automate Co-Pilot

Power Automate's new AI assistant was over sold with a very canned and simplistic demo. If you watch the sales pitch: 

<img src="https://msflowblogscdn.azureedge.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/PAD_GPTaction.gif" height="400" width="500">

It looks like it does _something_ in the demo and automates a lot of stuff. However, if you actually have used Power Platform, 
you will realize this particular example doesn't encompass the near infinite workflow scenarios that Power Platform facilitates.

This isn't to say that the Power Automate Copilot is useless. It does offer a nicer lookup of the documentation, I guess. But let's look
at it a different way - 

When I asked the Power Automate Co-Pilot to show me an example of how to use a Power App formula, it told me it couldn't do it. 
That's right, it just gave up. However, Bing Chat was more than happy to facilitate my request.

With that aside, I should emphasize that the power automate co-pilot is virtually no different from the original chat bot. 
It has slightly more "personality" and again, an improved documentation search, but beyond that, its newer features are 
all very specific. If you find something that works for your situation, I suppose you'll be happy. 

But for Power Apps, as far as I could tell, it's not there yet.

## Bing

And last we get to one of the more impressive, but sadly still not quite there products, Bing Chat. 

<a href="/Posts/Images/BingChat.png"><img src="/Posts/Images/BingChat.png" height="400" width="540"></a>

Bing's surprisingly robust, but that may be more or less, to be expected. The reason why I say that is Bing's chat is after all,
based on Chat GPT, something that Microsoft BOUGHT. This is not to totally knock MSFT either, but MSFT has an unfortunate reputation
for riding on the success of products that they purchased and had not invented on their own (I.E. SQL Server, Dot Net, etc).

So with the already rich features pointed out, what Bing Chat suffers from is more or less problems with itself. The biggest
problem being is that its dataset is not always 100% up to date. You can ask it questions and depending on how "historically sensitive"
the answer may be, you could end up getting clearly outdated information. Worse, you can end up getting nonsensical answers or other
concoctions because the fuzzy search built into Bing ended up being "cute".

Granted, these are just two complaints, but there are naturally more (limited number of messages in a conversation, lots of self censoring and funny ways you can make the bot "crash").


### Caveat - AI Isn't Really My Bag Of Things

I am going to go ahead and point out, before ending this, that I am by no means an "AI Expert". But as hinted, I have a very skeptical and cynical view of it. I am skeptical by nature, but I also am skeptical from having been a Software Engineer / Programmer and having messed with it enough to know what I can do with it...


## It Seems Mostly Like Gambling On What Will Stick

Ultimately, all of this stuff (along with the countless other products MSFT is inserting AI, I.E. Teams) seems more like a hedge than anything else to me.

I am skeptical they have the cloud computing resources as well as developers to keep this all maintained all at once. 
Surely there is probably something there in one of these ventures that will stick, and they likely will have the resources to maintain it, 
but everything else may go the way of Zune. There are others who I think would disagree, but again, I remain skeptical that MSFT can handle all of this, all at once.

So my guess is, they are throwing all of these things out, purely just to see what sticks. I am sure Sataya is aware of the[ liklihood at least one of these ventures will end up resulting in a lawsuit 🔗](https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/12/github_microsoft_openai_copilot/). That along with Microsoft's history of trying out mulitple things at once to see what sticks, I think a lot of this is ultimately more of the same from Sataya & Co.

They are probably also taking into consideration as to whether or not AI as a whole will acheive its hype or at least in some way, remain a part of society after the next 2-4 years. Assuming the economy improves at some point, we may see the demands for AI to fall. This would reduce the overall demand for MSFT's products having AI in them, and subsequentialy, they will have to fall back on other software goals in order to maintain their spot as the worlds largest software company.

My guess is that Bing Chat will probably be the winner. Github Copilot maybe, but the rest may become fixtures that language in maintenance modes.

MSFT itself may also be taking a dent at some point in the near future, but my financial instincts are not the greatest. So I will say I'm not as skeptical about their stock as I am about their products directions for the oncoming future.
