# Should I Make Yet Another Blog?
I have made blogs in the past, but they always either fell into disuse... I question how long I could keep this up.

However, I do want to do something to play with Blazor and Static sites. And this site could be something else besides just a blog.

So I think I will do it.


# Why Blazor?

I'll make it no secret that I really do love Blazor. It's IMO, one of the best things Microsoft has put out in the past 3-5 years.
(my thoughts about MSFT though are many, so I will save that for another blog post). I also think it makes web development more fun! And, I love how the great tooling available for .NET can be used across the whole stack.

# What Else Will Be Here Besides A Blog?

Maybe(?):

    - My Resume (Since I stopped using LinkedIn... 🤭)
    - Some dead simple Blazor componets made for no good reason
    - Anything else I haven't thought of...
