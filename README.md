# Drag_Static_Site
This is a static website I made to host a blog and anything else I feel like making.

The site is a Blazor Web Assembly app using:

- MudBlazor
- MudBlazor.MarkDown 
- Blazored.LocalStorage

[You Can Find The Site By Clicking The Link Here](https://dragnilar.github.io/Drag_Static_Site/)
