# Thoughts On Patch 4 for Baldurs Gate 3

I don't have very many about this, but today I didn't feel like writing much anyways.

- [The bug fix for the WASD mod was definitely needed 🔗](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/781). It's a shame Larian didn't think or have the time to implement WASD movement on their own. The game is
rather unplayable without the mod.
    - The speed at which the developer for that mod addressed the bug though, is greatly appreciated.

- Gotta love all the error messages that shoot across the screen, especially considering the liklihood someone may have mods with this game.
- I do not see the big deal with the glammoring mirror or whatever they call it. I'm pretty happy with how my Dragonborn Pally looks.


### That's about it.
