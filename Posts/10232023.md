# C# 11 Features / Thoughts

### Generic Attributes
- I haven't run into any situations where I actually needed this feature. 🫤
#### Rating: 1 / 5

### Generic Math Support
- I've used the new features around this (I.E. Static & Virtual interface memebers). It's kind of cool and does save some time. 
- However, I do see the complaints about it (the whole matter of interface behavior adjustments since C# 8, is a big subject into itself.)
#### Rating 3 / 5

### Numeric `IntPtr` and `UIntPtr` 
- The native integers needed these; I don't use them enough to be that excited.
#### Rating 2.5 / 5

### Pattern Matching / List Patterns

- I've used this a few times, but only really if it saves space and/or r# suggests it for me. 
- Ultimately I think this one is more of a "if you like it, use it" feature, but not something that's a game changer.
#### Rating 3/5

#### Method Group Conversion to Delegate Improvement
- See the `IntPtr` comment up above, but reduce the excitement even further.
#### Rating 1.5 / 5

... I'll add my thoughts on the other features as time permits...

## C# 11 Overall Rating:
### 2.5 / 5 
- I think I liked 8/9/10 more.
