# Microsoft Ignite 2024 Pt 1: Power Platform Co-Stupid

Ignite, one of Microsoft's biggest trade shows, is coming up on its 2024 rendition very soon. 
Myself, being a .NET developer, am of course interested in what Microsoft (MSFT) has in store. Unfortunately, based on
a totally not thorogh study, it appears Ignite 2024 is almost entirely about MSFT's latest fixation - AI.

# MSFT: We're Now The AI Company

Microsoft has more or less been after the AI goalpost for a while. For starters, [ML.NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/machine-learning/how-does-mldotnet-work) 🔗 has been around for a couple of years.
There's a ton of other examples, but I'll leave you to go hunt them down. 

This of course got more serious after [MSFT bought Chat GPT earlier this year](https://www.technocracy.news/microsoft-invests-10-billion-in-chatgpt-maker-openai/) 🔗. Since then, MSFT has been riding high on its stock and much of that has been due to their AI hype. Unfortunately, me being skeptical / cynical of the whole thing, am not totally impressed.

# Paltry Offerings

Many of the AI innovations that MSFT has supposedly been selling as of late have been, for a lack of better words, terrible. The only exception may ironically be Bing Chat / Chat GPT. Yes, despite all the hype and hoorah, MSFT has managed to wrangle Bing into a somewhat effective fuzzy search + sentence completion site. 

But aside from Bing Chat, the other things that they've shown off have left me... unimpressed.

## CarHSE StudY: Power Automate Copilot

For example, Power Automate's new AI assistant was over sold with a very canned and simplistic demo. If you watch the sales pitch: 

<img src="https://msflowblogscdn.azureedge.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/PAD_GPTaction.gif">

It looks like it does _something_ in the demo and automates a lot of stuff. However, if you actually have used Power Platform, 
you will realize this particular example doesn't encompass the near infinite workflow scenarios that Power Platform facilitates.

This isn't to say that the Power Automate Copilot is useless. It does offer a nicer lookup of the documentation, I guess. But let's look
at it a different way - 

When I asked the Power Automate Co-Pilot to show me an example of how to use a Power App formula, it told me it couldn't do it. 
That's right, it just gave up. However, Bing Chat was more than happy to facilitate my request.

With that aside, I should emphasize that the power automate co-pilot is virtually no different from the original chat bot. 
It has slightly more "personality" and again, an improved documentation search, but beyond that, its newer features are 
all very specific. If you find something that works for your situation, I suppose you'll be happy. 

But for Power Apps, as far as I could tell, it's not there yet.

### To Be Continued

.... Since Ignite is still a few days away, I think this rant may have to take up more than one post. 😏

As of this writing, Ignite 2024 is slated for the week after next.
