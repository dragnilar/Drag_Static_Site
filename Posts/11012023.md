# Ignite 2024 - Blazor Offerings

Ignite 2024 will be upon us soon, so I'm curious to see what MSFT has for Blazor this year. I will make it no secret that I love Blazor.💚


## Surprisingly, Only 4 Sessions (with duplication!)

So for this year, using the search on [MSFT's own ignite website 🔗](https://ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/sessions?search=Blazor&sortBy=relevance), we can see that there are 4 sessions that match a search containing Blazor.

This seems kind of smol, when you consider there are over 500 sessions this year. I suppose this may be due the sheer quantity of MSFT's offerings, but it also could be due to the overall direction of Ignite this year....


There are also other sessions for ASP.NET Core, .NET 8, etc,. I won't complain, t's good to see some amount of representation for .NET this year. The topics themselves though:

### [What's New for Enterprise Developers in .NET 8, Q&A 🔗](https://ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/sessions/d9ea0d2c-1756-4ec6-91b2-8316e309d36a?source=sessions)

Of all the ones, this is probably the one I want to see the most. I am glad to see that Daniel Roth will be there to represent Blazor & ASP.NET. The others speakers, I am not so keen.



### [Lab: Building A Chat Bot w/ Blazor 🔗](https://ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/sessions/7d702927-b96d-499e-bf1c-87f68ebc8dd3?source=sessions)

I'm a bit underwhelmed by this particular topic, since there are already several recording and [guides on doing this exact same exercise 🔗](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-signalr/signalr-tutorial-build-blazor-server-chat-app). It was probably an easy pick for them since this year's ignite is all about AI, but still, I wish they had at least picked a different way of using AI with Blazor...

This session is being done twice, so really we only have three sessions...

### [Breakout: Building A Chat Bot W/ Blazor 🔗](https://ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/sessions/80cb0c1c-d2af-4e9d-975d-c94f135c976e?source=sessions)

Yeah, I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me as well, when I read this one. It's almost the same topic, albeit slightly different from the lab. I'm feeling underwhelmed right now.




## Could Be Better

I think it could have been better this year. For something MSFT has been touting so heavily (Blazor), I am really surprised they do not have more sessions for this year. Unless they are planning on adding more at the last minute, I think this year's Ignite looks to me, over-saturated with AI hype.
