# This Site Uses MudBlazor
### It Lives Up to Its Claim, BTW

[MudBlazor 🔗](https://www.mudblazor.com/) is probably one of the most impressive components libraries I have ever seen. It is a worth rival to the the likes of my personal favorite, [DevExpress 🔗](https://demos.devexpress.com/blazor/), [Telerik](https://demos.telerik.com/blazor-ui) 🔗 and a couple others. So in other words (and in case you were wondering), it is NOT a "Poor Man's Component Library". 

One of the things that they have that shocked me, was a very functional DataGrid. They also have Cell Editing, which is something DevExpress still doesn't have in their Blazor Data Grid.

The documentation and the quality of the API that is included with the controls is also amazingly polished. I would argue in some ways, its more polished than Bootstrap's documentation.

There are some features that DevExpress/Telerik, etc do provide that MudBlazor does not, so I wouldn't say it's a 100% replacement for everything. But even with the limitations, Mud is now my go-to add-on for Blazor for any new Blazor Project.




## This Site Also Uses The Mud Blazor Markdown Viewer

The "[Markdown component for MudBlazor](https://github.com/MyNihongo/MudBlazor.Markdown)" is what is being used to display this blog post.

It gets the job done, although it is not as fully featured as other Markdown plugins for ASP.NET/Blazor. If you're looking for something to edit Markdown, you're probably better off trying out the impressive [Blazor Markdown Editor](https://github.com/erossini/BlazorMarkdownEditor).
